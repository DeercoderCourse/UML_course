For slots = 50, the deadlock rate is as follows:
    30 times, 10 deadlock, 33%
    50 times, 13 deadlock, 26%
    100 times, 20 deadlock, 20%
-----

For the 50% rate of deadlock, we need to decrease the slot size from 50 to get the right value
according to the experiment, my best result is the 38, normally the value varies from 30 to 40.

------
For test of consumer size from 1 to 10, using the script and change its output to get each output
file c1, c2, c3, ... c10, as the output shows.
